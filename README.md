# cse546-project2
A file model.pk needs to be downloaded from this link for the code to work.

The file is saved by using pickle library to serialize the model object, which is not the same as the original model file, which was a .pt file.
After downloading, the file needs to be put into the /checkpoint/ folder with the exact same name for it to work.

A step by step explanation of how to build the model is included in the project report, however it needs altering the AWS authentications and things such as key values.

The data used to train the model is omitted in the submission, but the file mentioned above is the result after training the model with the data images.
